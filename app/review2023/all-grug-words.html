  Valdrin - Throne of the Lunar Soul Grug want to join the Paladins of Ausadjur!
  Grug love surprise when start album with no expect, then boom, it done! Time
  fly fast, Grug still as rock, ears glued to sound. Sound pouring honey in
  Grug's ears. Just keep listen. Barely feel like time move. Whole album done
  and Grug miss dinner. Album is big reminder - this why Grug love for black
  metal roar and guitar cry. This definitely make Grug want to make dungeon
  synth! Malokarpatan disappoint at Grug for saying they have “Dungeon synth”.
  Grug think they right! But if this not dungeon synth intros and sections then
  Grug really lost. Grug never like just one song one time. Grug always prefer
  whole album and this perfect album for that! Such long album but keep fresh
  and no drag. So good balance between fast metal and parts to breathe, with
  feels and speaking words. Whole life long Grug hear about how metal ugly. How
  listen to so ugly? Shouty shouty and evil guitar? Angry drums? Why? This so
  good example of metal being all those things but easy more beautiful than bird
  melodies. Get stuck in head! Grug struggle imagine anyone hear this and not
  love, not think "wow so pretty". So melodic so epic. Grug feel similar here
  than when Grug feel love to Moonlight Sorcery! Yes! Make Grug think that easy
  to impress Grug. Make album with big story stuck together. Make music that
  flow like water. Shout over it. Have beautiful guitar. Make feel head go back
  and forth. Have nice front picture. Then make interesting unique music. Easy!
  Valdrin definitely have all! Every shrine Grug build is for must listen music.
  But Grug really, really think you should have this journey! Grug favourite
  parts: 1. Neverafter `03:36` - First time Grug hear this clean guitar and
  spoken word smile wide! 1. Golden Walls of Ausadjur `01:30` - YYYEAH! Followed
  by beast riding feels! Followed by wild solo! 1. Seven Swords (In the Arsenal
  of Steel): `0:00` - Feel like DOOM intro. Not MF but game. When guitars join
  is difficult not feel like excited child Grug. 1. Paladins of Ausadjur `03:53`
  - Grug have deep internal need to sing with paladins! Grug want to also be
  hero! 1. Throne of the Lunar Soul `03:58` - Album has many perfect solos. This

  Grugs. They need many shiny rocks and time and much noise wha wha, NO!
  Sometime Grug think maybe could be nice have someone to throw rocks at or
  with. Black metal weird, like fire and ice together. Make feel fuzzy inside.
  Make feel fly high and stab hurt feels. Village on fire, snow fall, all same
  time. World full of fire, full of bad. Not things Grug can bonk with club.
  Music here make Grug not want little Grugs. Feel no sun come tomorrow. Cover
  painting match music good. Need much talent make music like this. Tell story.
  Go on journey. Have many voices, loud, feel lots. Lots of words. Think much.
  Very special. Synth demon make spooky whoooooo fit so great. Feel can't make
  fire. Just want sleep in dark. How Grug care for little Grug when world dark
  like this? When air around Grug feel heavy? Make Grug sad, make Grug mad! But
  things easy to smash, easy break. Hard to make good life without woe. Grug
  listen many time future again again. Grug favourite parts: 1. Distant Epitaphs
