Last thing Grug remember... Eating plants? Mushrooms? Grug think eat mushrooms? Grug asleep now? Grug awake? Walk in cloud? Grug floating in cave? Who made that fire? Fire burn strange colours? Someone screem? Tiger in cave? Ghost in cave? Grug panic. Grug calm.

So many styles. So many different feels.

So many different voices. Voice sound like in pain from stab! Voice that sound like sing on big stage opera! Voice of caveman!

Create so unique feeling. Grug know feeling of listening from cave very well. Here cave so strange. Cave colorful and decorate many strange things that Grug no have name for. Sounds Grug never hear before. Sounds no instrument Grug knows can make.
Instruments that Grug do know play perfect and many interesting.

Many sections for get punched so heavy. But when music go pretty it really, really, really, go pretty. Grug favourite parts in between songs when close to horror sounds. End of Crystallised and begin of Liquid Gold pretty in scary way.

Grug favourite parts:

1. Beyond Recognition `02:40` - Feel like someone reach to Grug in dream! Extreme calm but also worry and panic.
2. Crystallised `03:20` - This solo make Grug feel like floating in water in dark.
3. Liquid Gold `0:00` - Moment
4. The Paint of an Invader `0:00` - Moment
5. Birds and Machines in Brunswick `0:00` - Moment
6. Divine Laughter `0:00` - Moment
