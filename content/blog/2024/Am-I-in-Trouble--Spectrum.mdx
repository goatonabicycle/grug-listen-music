Grug knew immediately must build shrine for this magic!

Young Grug used to think would be great musician if just practice all time! All good musicians practice much of their days. But... Maybe just as important is being influence by things. By experience. Can best guitar player that know all ways to play perfect and fast create feeling of soaring black metal tremolo when never listen black metal at all? Maybe. Would be good? Not sure. This album leave Grug feeling better musician. Not because practice or learn songs, but because sounds teach Grug different things. Make Grug see music fresh. Make Grug appreciate deeper.

Album start and end so gentle and beautiful. Strings whisper secrets with smile. Could listen whole album just this! But whole sky crash down and get lift again! Sky full of so many different things - feeling, tone, voices, instruments, structure, chimes. Throat-growl becomes clean-sing becomes battle-cry. Guitars and bass speak different words but tell story with perfect understand between. Wind-pipe flute spirits dance through spaces between other sounds. Drums hold everything together like strong walls of cave. All sounds know exactly where going, even when path twists unexpected ways. But twists hook so deeply. Grug hum melodies throughout day!

  `Crown of flames` <br />
  `Breathe in, absorb` <br />
  `Breathe out, destroy` <br />
  `Give in to the rust` <br />
  `I have no form, no limits` <br />

Colours really meaningful! Yellow brings warmth of morning sun. White pushes blood fast through veins, makes Grug run with night creatures. Pink starts soft as falling snow, grows strong as mountain. Red burn blood. Blue opens skies. Black summons old spirits to hide it all. Green returns peace. Each carry spirit of colour into ears. Show colour shadows on wall! Grug thankful to have eyes and ears to experience all this magic.

Music hides many secrets in sound-forest. First listen only show small part of path. Must walk path many times to find all hidden treasures. Songs proud to show where ideas come from - old magic from times before. But also proud to show new magic made with old spells. Grug know practice good and important, but don't think can practice enough to make up for feels. Who you are and what shape you matter so much when make music. Grug thankful to be influence! Grug spirit grow bigger from these sounds.
