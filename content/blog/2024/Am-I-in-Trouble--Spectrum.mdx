[Words about album will go here]

Description from bandcamp: Spectrum is the debut album by Am I in Trouble?, an erratic journey through colorful black corners of metal.



A love-letter to the eclecticism and experimentation displayed in the early-to-mid 2000s avantgarde black metal explosion.



Releasing January 3, 2025, digitally, and on cassette tape via Negative Wingspan  (negativewingspan.bandcamp.com)



 Deeply influenced by the works of artists active during this time, however, the goal was not to recreate and imitate these bands—but rather, to extract elements from their approaches to creation—and in doing so, develop something new— filtered through the unique vision of multi-instrumentalist Steve Wiener.



Despite Am I in Trouble? being a solo project, there is a keen emphasis on collaborative and guest contributions.



The most foundational of which is the incredible drum performance by UK drummer Chris Barber. Chris took every drum arrangement in expert stride, breathing incredible life into every moment.



Canadian folk metal artist Ember Belladonna contributes flute to three tracks. Inspired deeply by the synth-based flute arrangements by Lars Nedland throughout Borknagar and Solefald's careers; a goal on Spectrum was to see that approach brought to life with real flutes. Ember beautifully accomplished that goal.



What good is being in multiple bands if you can't feature your bandmates as guests? Co-lead vocalist / bassist, Jonathan Hernandez, and co-guitarist Paul Shryock, of Steve's other band, Negative Bliss each feature on tracks, contributing parts that—despite solo projects being wonderful in their one way—are a firm reminder of the magic that only comes from being in a band with other people.



UK vocalist Alex Loach of Ashenheart rounds out the guest list, providing his trademark venomous shrieks to Black.



Spectrum is a deliberately disparate, vivid and varied musical journey.
