Grug know this because of jtextreme. You should look him dancing. Very best Justin.

Song writing so nice. Feel free and happy to take on adventure.

Each song its own tiny shrine. Each song make specific feelings.

Vibes. Make grug feel home. Scared of home, sure. But this is comfort music for Grug. Not mean it soft or happy. Very opposite.

Beautiful black metal. Pull at Grug heart strings. Soar and feels!
