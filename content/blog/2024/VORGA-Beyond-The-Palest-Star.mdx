# What is this cover?

# Vocals, Instruments

Keys that twinkle like stars. Drums that pound like heart. Guitars that scream like wind. Vocals that roar like beast.

# Theme

Grug no understand space. Too big for think. How even go there? Maybe jump really high? Maybe if climb very high on mountain. Maybe if build very tall tower from rock. Maybe on this music can take there?

# Feeling

Grug so happy. Very listen to black metal for feels. Mostly feels feel sad or inside. Like something hanging onto Grug heart and jumping up and down.
Here feels much big. Not focus on heart. Focus on make Grug fly!
