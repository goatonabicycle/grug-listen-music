    <p>Grug never listen this band before. Fresh! Grug immediate feel like in danger when start.</p>

    <p>On outside, make Grug feel like cave suddenly 5 times smaller. Not enough air for breathe. Even cover look tight on Grug website! On inside like when eat something bad and you feel bad in stomach. Then when think about food, stomach do whirl.</p>

    <p>All instrument float around each other. All swallow into same throat. Drums hit on every wall inside head. Guitar and bass evil and blur and fog! Voice keep Grug scared to even approach. Grug thankful for breaks in between big songs. Surprise many times!</p>

    <p>This music like fire burning far away but coming closer and closer. Know will burn everything around. Burn so many direction. But fire move too fast to get out of way. Music never go where think will go! Always twist, turn, explode!</p>

<p style={{marginTop: "0px"}}>Very difficult album that must listen. For how scary and intense, also bring meditate and calm. Best way to escape. Not listen while do other things. Not listen while walk. Not while laying on couch. Grug feel have to sit quiet and focus. Otherwise will attack.</p>

<p>Grug love that this music exist. Wonder if old Grug like Grug grandparents could imagine music like this exist even 10000 moon up and downs from now.</p>

<p>Grug immediately listen again. Want to not end.</p>
