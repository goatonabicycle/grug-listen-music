    <p>Grug ears not ready! First note hit, Grug body turn to stone. Music grab Grug by throat, shake hard. Fresh and dangerous! Grug immediate feel in danger.</p>

    <p>Walls of cave crush inward when music play. Air get thick, hard breathe. Even cover look tight on Grug website! On inside like when eat something bad and you feel bad in stomach. Then when think about food, stomach do whirl.</p>

    <p>Music swallow Grug whole. All instrument float around each other. All swallow into same throat. Drums not just hit - drums SMASH through bone. Bass crawl under skin. Guitar screech and howl! Voice... voice make Grug want stay hide in cave. But Grug also want hear more. Between big songs, Grug happy for air. So many surprise.</p>

    <p>This music like fire burning far away but coming closer and closer. Know will burn everything around. Burn so many direction. But fire move too fast to get out of way. Music never go where think will go! Always twist, turn, explode like angry sky gods having battle!</p>

  Very difficult album that must listen. For how scary and intense, also bring
  meditate and calm. Best way to escape. Not listen while do other thing. Not
  listen while walk. Not while laying on rug. Grug feel have to sit quiet and
  focus. Need all senses for focus.
</p>

<p>
  Grug love that this music exist. If show Grug great-great-grandparents would
  think world end! Could never think music like this exist even 10000 moon up
  and downs from now.
</p>

<p>Grug immediately listen again. Want to not end.</p>
