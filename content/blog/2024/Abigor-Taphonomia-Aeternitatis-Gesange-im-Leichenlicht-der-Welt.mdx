Where does evil feel come from? Churchbells and creepy ambience? Cover? Sure.

But also! Vocals! Clean like evil man. Raspy like drowning in vomit. Guitar light. Like light shining out of them. Light that make you feel sick. Guitar disorientating. Not afraid of being center of attention. Many changes. Guitars feel like evil children wandering around. But erupt randomly when man shouts at them! Become evil beasts. Feel you can see how guitars dance uncontrolably.

Very melodic feel. Evil definitely come from feeling of sitting in a group and listening to evil cult leader man talking to people, shouting, snarling. Closest Grug have felt to being in some ritual where people are sacrifice and drink blood. Soft spot Grug heart when no music but only vocals to lead the song along. Grug wouldn’t want to have dinner with the voice man. Also not with lady though. So thrilling. Grug can’t stop. Feel want to hear what happen next at every moment of every song. And then singing in German? Are you joking? Yes! Crowd vocals? Yes!

Black metal can be for sad, for epic feel, for fight. This black metal for evil! Feel so inspire by classical music. Melodic. Sinister. Make feel bad for other bands with the amount of melody and interesting played with here.

Grug favourite parts:

1. Soldaten Satans `02:07`- How it possible that riff sound spiteful? Like sticking out tongue and taunting.
1. Feasting On The Prophet's Blood `01:28`- Other man voice so creepy!
1. Extermination Angel`02:03`- Random violent screem as if for help.
1. Cult Of Elder Chaos`01:34`- Opressive vibes. Make Grug feel underwater and drowning.
1. Burning Hell`02:52`- This little throwaway riff is early contender for riff of year.
1. Forniotrs Weltenreise`04:55` - This vocal section stuck in Grug head. Would happy follow man to final fight.
