Grug think we can start immediately with the horse penis. Yes. Grug listen to this because horse penis. But what else is here? This the music you want to hear live in caveman basement, sweating to death, jumping around with strangers.

Immediately aggressive. Feel like running towards a fire. Grug love guitar tone. It feel like strings wet! Dripping with green goo. Dripping into ears and making burn! Shouts and music make so easy to bob head. Grug enjoy when can hear accent in album

Simple but very catchy. Not feeling make head whirl. Make head bounce! So many riffs for stuck in head. So many punch in head.
Grug feel like big hammers falling on head. Hammers where the head part actually boulders! First time it weird. Where hammer come from? But then another and another hammer! Too many hammers! Guitars so heavy that it sounds like bass guitar. It make no sense to rank guitars by their perceived size. But if had to, this would be mammoth guitar. Stomping and generally causing noise Grug no sleep because so loud outside cave!
