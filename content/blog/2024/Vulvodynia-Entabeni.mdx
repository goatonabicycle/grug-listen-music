Grug cheap date when come to make weird sounds with mouth. Grug get even cheaper when make music that make shoulder jiggle side to side.

Blow mind that vocal also play so good guitar. Themes from land that make interesting.

Grug build shrine special for band from Grug land. So much chunk feel.

Grug love dance groove when solos. Feel like sudden very focus!

Catchy parts get stuck in head for days. Grug randomly go "Where she goes, it follows!". Every song have big personality.

More pinch harmonics than [pinch harmonic joke]

Bass feel so chunky. Feel so unique. Easily the most African metal band in terms of sound.

Grug favourite parts:

2. Devil Tree `01:20` - Moment
3. The Randlord `0:00` - Moment
4. Isandlwana (feat. David John Simonich) `01:26` - Grug not sure how to describe this but ever feel like a song is laughing in your face?
5. Mamlambo `1:00` - Like being slammed into a room full of tiny bells.
6. Adamaster (feat. Kyle Medina) `0:00` - Vocalist so good. At guitar.
7. Entabeni (feat. Damonteal Harris) `0:00` - This intro most slap in face. So easy to hum while make coffee.
8. Mangled and Maimed `03:06` - In album full of solos, Grug think you should listen this one.
9. Generational Segregation `0:00` - Moment
