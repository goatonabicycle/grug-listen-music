Grug not know what Vulvodynia is. Sort of don't want to know and seem painful? Not smart enough this medicine stuff. Grug not sure if even good or bad!

This music feel like want to hurt you like medical worry. Grug love bass that feel thick thick thick! Like biting into a wet slime stick. So much chunk in music! So much good instrument play make go wow so much. Special wow for so many pinch harmonics, Grug think crabs trying to bite toes! Feel like want to play guitar also! Grug love when solos come and change whole conversation.

  `The land of gold ` <br />
  `Draped round my neck` <br />
  `A mountain of diamonds ` <br />
  `glisten on my chest`
</div>

Catchy parts get stuck in head for days. Grug randomly go "Where she goes, it follows!" and make echo in cave. Every song have big personality. Sometimes feel like holding slippery snake covered in oil. Other times feel like wrestle big, angry bear! Vulvodynia happy to slam ears to ground!

Grug love this album for feel fun. For feel want to play guitar. For dance around fire. Nothing make Grug happier than build special shrine for band from Grug land. Stories from land of Grug make Grug heart feel big. Maybe too big. Maybe Vulvodynia mean when heart has pain, burning, and discomfort? Maybe it if heart too big from great music?
