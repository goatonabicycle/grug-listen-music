Grug care for music that...

Grug cheap date when come to make weird sounds with mouth. Grug get even cheaper when make music that make shoulder jiggle side to side.

Bass feel so chunky. Feel so unique. Blow mind that vocal also play so good guitar. Grug love dance groove when solos. Feel like sudden very focus! So many pinch harmonics Grug scared for crabs biting Grug feet! And not for show how good play. But for make song good!

Catchy parts get stuck in head for days. Grug randomly go "Where she goes, it follows!". Every song have big personality and so much for make go "Wowee". Sometimes feel like snake cover in oil in hands. Sometime feel like trying to pick up big bear! Vulvodynia not play games with listener ears.

Nothing make Grug happier than build shrine special for band from Grug land. Stories here from from land of Grug! Love so much! So much chunk feel. Grug not only thankful for music from South Africa, but very thankful that music this good!

Grug favourite parts:

1. Mangled and Maimed `03:06` - In album full of solos, Grug think you should listen this one.
1. Isandlwana (feat. David John Simonich) `01:26` - Grug not sure how to describe this but ever feel like a song is laughing in your face?
1. Mamlambo `1:00` - Like being slammed into a room full of tiny bells.
1. Adamaster (feat. Kyle Medina) `0:00` - Vocalist so good. At guitar.
1. Entabeni (feat. Damonteal Harris) `0:00` - This intro most slap in face. So easy to hum while make coffee.
