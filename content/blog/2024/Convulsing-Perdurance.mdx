Grug love when feel like face warm from sitting close to fire with friend.

Crunch of guitar, sound of fingers on string, breath of singer.

Walking with this music feel calm and slow in flowers sometimes. Next moment running while being chased by big cat. Grug love this feeling.

Feel special for having hear this music. Feel like many different places. Sometimes alone in empty house in middle desert. Sometime in big city many people shout.

Guitar slide around so much. Wiggle wiggle up down. Make Grug feel like in jungle with snake.

Guitar sound like big storm. Like everything bother. Like no time for anything. Like so hurry that lose tempo and

Then sound like relax. Like nothing bother. Like have all time in world.

Voice sounds that can understand clear. Feel emotion so bright in shouts.

Feel like worms wriggle around in a can. Grug not eat. But what if nothing else have eat?

Make Grug hopeful for future full of good music because present definitely have.

Music feel like stuck in butchery.

Grug favourite parts:

1. pentarch `04:28` - Confusing guitar sound like Grug head when think too much and have.
2. flayed `04:40` - Guitar sound like shiver from cold teeth clatter.
3. shattered temples `01:34` - Feel like someone have rope around your arms and pulling you!
4. endurance `04:28` - Not quickly forgotten
