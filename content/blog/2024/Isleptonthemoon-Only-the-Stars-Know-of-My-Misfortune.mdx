Grug not listen to emo/depressive related like music in long time. Younger Grug love emo music. Back then, Grug put posters on wall, wear black animal pelts, write bad poetry. This would have melt young Grug brain! Make now Grug remember why music so powerful. This album make Grug chest feel like cave after rain - empty but full of new life.

Music feel like was made while floating in space. Every sound have room to exist, even in chaos. Voice come from far away - sometimes quiet like counting stars, sometimes loud like watching meteor crash. Black metal parts like storm cloud, but then gentle parts like clear, starry night sky. Not fight each other - dance together peacefully! Every instrument have own space to flow. Even when all instruments play loud together, Grug feel how important every touch. Guitar clean and not clean have so great feeling. Keys float above like ghost birds, watching guitar fight below. Drums know exactly when be gentle and when be strong.

  `So I could keep hidden from you like I always do` <br />
  `When the day gets late can we watch the sun break in two?` <br />
  `And I'll keep hidden from you like I'm known to do` <br />
  `When the sky turns black can we stare at the blood red moon?`

Grug love how strong this album connect with Grug. Maybe Grug cheap date, but moving from soft and slow to loud and violent is easiest way to please brain. This album master of that. Strange how album can feel so sad but also make feel less alone. If Grug were on Moon, might feel very, very alone. This album like finding footprints of other grugs who have walk here before.

This album for alone and Grug recommend not listen if want to have normal day because will have big sack of feelings have to carry around. Album like short storm, but fill heart like whole season worth of rain.

**Grug favourite parts:**

1. Dimming Light `00:46` - This riff alone make one of Grug favourite albums ever.
1. Safety `03:08` - Keys like ghost touch Grug shoulder.
1. Maybe I Don't Know It Yet, but Good Things Are Coming Soon `03:42` - "Good Things Are Coming Soon"
1. Like Dying `03:46` - Raining outside, feel safe. Raging inside, feel not safe.
