Grug not listen to emo like music in long time. Younger Grug loved emo music. This would have melted brain. 

Voice from far away. Trying to tell something must know. Voice also normal speak words that make feel shouldn't be hearing. Personal conversation!
Guitar both clean and not clean have such great feeling. Keys add so much atmosphere and presence to already 
Music have a lightness to it that make feel like comfort. But devastate underneath!

Grug not connect on feels level with album so much long time. Like having feelings of sad and joy pumped directly into brain.
Maybe Grug cheap date, but moving from soft and slow to loud and violent is easiest way to please Grug brain. This album master of that.
This mix of music feel so powerful for Grug. Black metal already normal have many feels. This make feelings pond full!

  `So I could keep hidden from you like I always do` <br />
  `When the day gets late can we watch the sun break in two?` <br />
  `And I'll keep hidden from you like I'm known to do` <br />
  `When the sky turns black can we stare at the blood red moon?`

Grug recommend not listen if want to have normal day. Will have big sack of feelings to have to carry around. Grug spend lots of time alone. Lots of time with friends. Lots of time with loved humans. This album for alone. Alone with many thoughts and feels

Grug want to be playing with sticks and rocks again. Grug listen to this album so many times and will listen so many times more.



Grug favourite parts:

1. Safety  `2:02` - Love how dissonant specific not feels. Very powerful and uneasy. Warn of big things coming!. 03:10. keys.
1. Dimming Light `00:46` - This riff alone make this one of Grug favourite albums.
1. Maybe I Don’t Know It Yet, but Good Things Are Coming Soon 03:42 - Spoken word leading into burst. Favourite!
