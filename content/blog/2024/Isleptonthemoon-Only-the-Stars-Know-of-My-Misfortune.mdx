Grug not connect on feels level with album so much long time. 

Voice from far away. Trying to tell something must know. 
Voice also normal speak words that make feel shouldn't be hearing. Personal conversation!

Like having feelings of sad and joy pumped directly into brain.

--------------------------------------------------------

Dear brother, I'm honestly letting it sink in
We're not the kids we were
Time has taken me further from when we were brothers
We're not the kids we were

--------------------------------------------------------

This mix of music feel so powerful for Grug. Black metal already normal have many feels. This make feelings pond full!

Grug listen to this album so many times and will listen so many times more.
