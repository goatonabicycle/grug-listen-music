Grug not listen to emo like music in long time. Younger Grug love emo music. Back then, Grug put posters on cave wall, wear black animal pelts, write bad poetry. This would have melt young Grug brain! Make now Grug remember why music so powerful.

Music feel like was made while floating in space. Feel like hearing friend tell secret. Voice echo from far away. Sometimes whisper secrets Grug feel not supposed to hear, like hearing friends trading secrets. Even when voice fly like comet, always feel like personal conversation between stars. Music like when Grug mix different berries in water - some sweet, some bitter. But make thirsty go away. Black metal parts like storm cloud, but then gentle parts like morning after rain. Not fight each other - dance together peacefully! Every instrument have own space to flow. Even when all instruments play loud together, Grug feel how important every touch. Guitar both clean and not clean have such great feeling. Keys float above like ghost birds, watching guitar fight below. Drums know exactly when be gentle and when be strong.

<div className="text-center">
  `So I could keep hidden from you like I always do` <br />
  `When the day gets late can we watch the sun break in two?` <br />
  `And I'll keep hidden from you like I'm known to do` <br />
  `When the sky turns black can we stare at the blood red moon?`
</div>

 Grug not connect on feels level with album so much long time. Maybe Grug cheap date, but moving from soft and slow to loud and violent is easiest way to please Grug brain. This album master of that. This album make Grug chest feel like cave after rain - empty but full of new life. Strange how album can feel so sad but also make feel less alone. If Grug were on Moon, might feel very, very alone. This album like finding footprints of other grugs who have walked here before.

This album for alone and Grug recommend not listen if want to have normal day. Will have big sack of feelings to have to carry around. Album like short storm, but fill heart like whole season worth of rain.

**Grug favourite parts:**

1. Dimming Light `00:46` - Feeling this riff alone make makes one of Grug favourite albums.
1. Safety `2:02` - Keys at 03:09 like ghost touch Grug shoulder.
1. Maybe I Don't Know It Yet, but Good Things Are Coming Soon `03:42` - Spoken word make Grug think of playing with friends when small. When burst come, feel like all memories hit at once!
1. Like Dying `03:46` - Love piano here. Make Grug think of rain on cave roof while safe inside.
