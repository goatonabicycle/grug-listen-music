Grug not connect on feels level with album so much long time. 

Voice from far away. Trying to tell something must know. 
Voice also normal speak words that make feel shouldn't be hearing. Personal conversation!
Grug recommend not listen if want to have normal day. Will have big sack of feelings to have to carry around. 
Grug not listen to emo like music in long time. 
Like having feelings of sad and joy pumped directly into brain.
Younger Grug loved emo music. This would have melted brain. 
Grug spend lots of time alone. Lots of time with friends. Lots of time with loved humans. This album for alone. Alone with many thoughts and feels
Maybe Grug cheap date, but moving from soft and slow to loud and violent is easiest way to please Grug brain. This album master of that.
Keys add so much atmosphere.
Music have a lightness to it that make feel like comfort. But devastate underneath!
Grug want to be playing with sticks and rocks again. 
This mix of music feel so powerful for Grug. Black metal already normal have many feels. This make feelings pond full!
Grug listen to this album so many times and will listen so many times more.

Dear brother, I'm honestly letting it sink in
We're not the kids we were
Time has taken me further from when we were brothers
We're not the kids we were
