Description from bandcamp: ***THIS ALBUM IS AVAILABLE ON LIMITED VINYL VIA BINDRUNE RECORDINGS. LINK HERE:  bindrunerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/only-the-stars-know-of-my-misfortune



 Only the Stars Know of My Misfortune is the third full-length album from by the anonymous, one-man band, ISLEPTONTHEMOON.



"With a mix of post rock, shoegaze and depressive black metal, the soundscape unveiled by Georgia's own ISLEPTONTHEMOON is a moving experience to behold. Only the Stars Know of My Sorrow is pure emotion. Raw. Unfiltered. The music hits like a hot wire of traumatic life experience processed through embattled feelings where depression, anger and even moments of joy congeal into this vibrant union of musical styles. What you get out of the experience, is what you go into it carrying with you. Only the Stars Know of My Misfortune is a vibrant album that we're pleased to share with the world."
