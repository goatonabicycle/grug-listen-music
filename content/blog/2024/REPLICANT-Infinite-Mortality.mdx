Feel like Grug get drown in sand. Like room listening in feel difficult to breathe in.

Perfect for want most chaos and angry possible. Just most wild and swinging. Songs sometime pretend going to now be slow only for sudden punch in stomach. Sometimes go so fast and sometimes go slow. Is new song? Is same song? Grug can't hold all these riffs! Feeling like every instrument weigh very heavy.

Grug wonder if holding guitar in hands make jump with how primal feels. How even hold on when guitar this wild? Guitar must have hair in all places. Favourite when kick drums make kicks but then sometime make quick small kicks faster. Voice always sound like shouting directly at face. Spitting. Grug have to wipe spit off uni-brow. Gargling and dripping out little bits of flesh.

Powerful and excited for more. Grug never hear Replicant before but now listening to all old music! Grug struggle make favourite part. Album feel like can close eyes and skip to any random moment and will be met with chunky riff that make go stank face. Every song feel like a thousand beasts you have never seen before running past you but they are all on fire.

Grug favourite parts:

1. Acid Mirror `03:44` - This sound like Grug dad when not want eat food.
2. Shrine to the Incomprehensible `02:45` - This riff feel like it knows how cool it is.
3. Orgasm of Bereavement `02:40` - Bass guitar bring friends to beat you up. Guitar frens very scary but then other fren can bark like pig.
4. Reciprocal Abandonment `0:56` - When riffs feel like mindless machine stamping your face into cave wall.
5. Pain Enduring `0:17` - Grug feel this for every riff here but this actually favourite riff on album.
6. Nekrotunnel `01:02` - Is it worth building shrine if album not have "OEH" sound?
7. Planet of Skin `08:20` - A blobby human sack of flesh exploding would not sound this meaty.
