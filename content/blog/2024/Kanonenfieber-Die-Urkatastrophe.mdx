Grug go Germanyland recently.

Grug feel more connect. War museum make feel very more real.

Music

Music so angry. Grug feel fighting someone cannot see.

Catchy, many effects. Whistles for run forward.

Black metal that make feel flying. Not like bird, but like artillery fire.

Vocal such great at melody and flow. Poetry. Music powerful and guitar make creepy feels.

Not all evil though. Feel nice at time. Scary other. Big bring of scary is voice. German sound so angry! When crowd also shout make Grug feel for want fater land. Grug promise these songs get stuck in head.

Lyrics
Grug no understand words. Make it better. Make it scarier. Grug ask shaman of magic and tribe knowledge about translate and tell Grug of big stories of many people dying. Not think would be as good in English.
