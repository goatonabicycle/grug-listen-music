Grug lucky! Grug go Germanyland recently. Was good! Germanyland not like Grug cave. Grug heart big happy when listen Germanyland music!

This music so unique. Make feel like history lesson! Like learn about moles and tank and scary! No make war look shiny. Make war look scary! Not about glory, more like a warning.

Sounds so angry. Grug feel fighting someone cannot see. Catchy, many effects. Whistles for run forward. Horses, skybirds, shooting!
Black metal that make feel flying. Not like bird, but like artillery fire. Vocal such great at melody and flow. Poetry. Music powerful and guitar make creepy feels.
Not all time scary. Sometimes nice like warm fire. Big bring of scary is voice. German sound so angry! When crowd also shout make Grug feel part of the waste of life. Songs get stuck so deep in head.

Grug no understand words. Make it better. Make it scarier. Grug ask shaman of magic and tribe knowledge about translate and tell Grug of big stories of many people dying. Not think would be as good in English.

Grug love when music can be so harsh but also be appreciate even by frens not normally listen this type music. Every moment this album feel special and designed to Grug liking.
Very rare that when song start Grug immediately remember it and know the feels!
