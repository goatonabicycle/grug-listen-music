[Words about album will go here]

Description from bandcamp: As with its predecessor, KANONENFIEBER’s second album “Die Urkatastrophe” is based on factual reports, letters and original documents from the surviving and deceased soldiers from the First World War. Its intent is not to glorify, because there is no glory in war. 

Everyone loses – their lives, their souls, their humanity. 

This album is intended to commemorate the countless victims of WWI.

War is often depicted in an abstract way, through numbers and statistics. 

KANONENFIEBER aim to tell the stories of the nameless and the faceless in order to allow for a small glimpse of their personal horrors, and thereby the larger scale horror for mankind as a whole.

KANONENFIEBER’s black and death metal isn’t meant to solely entertain, but also educate and raise awareness against the glorification of war.
