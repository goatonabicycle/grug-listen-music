Grug lucky to be in Germanyland when write this. Germanyland not like Grug cave. Very different! But Grug big happy to have really great music from Germanyland!

Just like walk around in big, old city, Grug love feeling of get history lesson! Grug so excite for learn about moles and tank and scary! This no make war look shiny. Make war look scary! More warning than glory. Instruments so tight and angry! Catchy, many effects. Whistles for run forward. Horses, sky-birds, shooting! Grug feel fighting with someone cannot see. Many moments of feel flying. Not like bird, but like big cannon shooting fire!

Vocals such great at melody, flow, and scary! Glue everything together perfect! German sound so angry! When crowd also shout make Grug feel part of the waste of life.
Grug no understand words. Make it better and scarier. Grug ask shaman of magic and tribe knowledge about translate and tell Grug of big stories of many people dying. Not think would be as good if sing English.

This album for story! Small stories all make big story together. Every song very unique and own special feel. Get stuck so deep in head! Grug love when music can be so harsh but also be appreciate even by frens not normally listen this type music. Very rare that when song start Grug immediately remember it and know the feels! Every moment this album feel special and designed to Grug liking.

Love this album for so tight, so stories, and so fun to listen to!

1. Lviv zu Lemberg `4:10` - Guitar solo make Grug sad for soldier grandpa Grug never had.
1. Panzerhenker `02:30` - Feel like being in a truck that just drove over a landmine.
