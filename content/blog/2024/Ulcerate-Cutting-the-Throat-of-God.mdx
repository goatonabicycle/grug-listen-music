[Words about album will go here]

Grug never listen to Ulcerate before. Grug see name and think “cool name” but when listen never click. Too much chaos. Too much confuse. How listen this? Grug brain too smol? Grug brain too big?

Now listen as grown up Grug. Listen with new ears. Sounds that make Grug ears feel clean and dirty at same time. Move more than any music Grug ever hear. Like shadows reflect on cave wall from big fire.

Grug could practice every minute for rest of live and not be this good at any of the instruments here.

Grug know friends listen music for background. Listen music while focus something else. Ulcerate force you to put down something else and pay attention.

This album like special treasure you find and want to keep with you always. Like when little Grug get gift and then keep next to pillow when sleep.

Grug special feel for drums. All play silly good. But drums special place heart. Normal metal barely understand. Here it's ununderstand and struggle to even begin picture how Grug could ever play stick like this.

This difficult album for Grug. But so satisfy. So much learn about what music can be. So much appreciate for what we humans can do.
