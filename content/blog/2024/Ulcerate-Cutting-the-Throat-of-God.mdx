Grug never listen to Ulcerate before. Grug see name and think “cool name” but when listen never click. Too much chaos. Too much confuse. How listen this? Grug brain too smol?

Now listen as grown up Grug. Listen with new ears. Sounds that make Grug ears feel clean and dirty at same time. Move more than any music Grug ever hear. Like too many shadows reflect on cave wall. Too many shadow for such small fire.

Grug know friends listen music for background. Listen music while focus something else. Ulcerate force you to put down something else and pay attention.

<div className="text-center">
  `In the grasp of forfeiture` <br />
  `The light is all but gone` <br />
  `Stasis lies between the vestige` <br />
  `And the altar upon which it rests` <br />
  `Stasis lies at the precipice`
</div>

All instrument play silly good. Drums special place heart. Normal metal barely understand how play. Here struggle to even begin picture how Grug could ever play stick like this. Grug could practice every minute for rest of live and not be this good at any of the instruments here. Guitar moan like have pain for 100 years. Guitar sound like biggest monster and smallest baby at same time. Like air clear and full at same time.

So much learn about what music can be. So much appreciate for what big unique humans can do. Maybe feel like sandwich that think maybe too many things on. But then discover perfect sandwich actually. Sandwich that will scoop out your heart.
