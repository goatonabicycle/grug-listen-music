Grug first time listen Ulcerate. Always see and think “cool name” but when listen never click. When listen brain feel like rock slide. Chaos everywhere! Grug wonder, do ears work right? Brain too smol to understand?

Now Grug older, wiser, hairier. Listen again with ears of old Grug. Sounds make ears feel like bath in lovely mud - clean and dirty all at once. Like rain after many days no rain. Music move Grug like no other. Like whole tribe dancing in shadows on cave wall, fire too small for such big story. Shadows twist, turn, make Grug feel alive!

Grug know friends listen music for background. Listen music while focus something else. But Ulcerate grab by fur, say 'No! Sit, listen, feel!'. Music demand all Grug attention.

<div className="text-center">
  `In the grasp of forfeiture` <br />
  `The light is all but gone` <br />
  `Stasis lies between the vestige` <br />
  `And the altar upon which it rests` <br />
  `Stasis lies at the precipice`
</div>

All instrument play silly good. Drums special place heart. Normal metal barely understand how play. Here struggle to even begin picture how Grug could ever bang sticks like this. Grug could practice every minute for rest of live and not be this good at any of instruments here. Guitar moan like have pain for 100 years. Guitar sound like biggest monster and dying wolf at same time. Like air clear and thick at same time. Like storm loom.

So much learn about what music can be. So much appreciate for what big unique can be done by humans. Maybe feel like sandwich that maybe too many things on. But then discover perfect sandwich actually. Sandwich that will scoop out your heart. Sandwich that nobody else could ever make.

1. Cutting the Throat of God `02:20` - Grug never had throat cut. But this must be what throat cut sound like?
