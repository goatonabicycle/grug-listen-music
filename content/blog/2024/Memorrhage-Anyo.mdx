Intro
What? Grug not think will like nu-metal. What even is that?
Grug wonder if cover have two robots making baby robots maybe? Or one robot on knee asking other robot for marry?

What? What these feels? What these known sounds that Grug not hear so long? Tiny baby Grug would be eye wide when share with friends. Remind of much simpler time.

Not just old time feelings that make good. This good as own seperate new thing. Maybe Grug not able to listen all music out there but Grug very sure nothing else like this out there.

All other music so easy but in bucket. Black metal, Deathcore, whatever. Here feel like there bucket but nobody else but berries in this bucket.

Grug love this album. See it like when speak. We make new words every day. New words will not stop. Always make new words. Same way for music. Always make new music. Never can run out of new ideas. Grug think that pretty cool.
