[Words about album will go here]

Description from bandcamp: Unsurprisingly, considering the band's acclaimed body of work to date, this is no run-of-the-mill Tech-Death album. The talented duo of guitarist and engineer Norbert Müller and vocalist, guitarist, and composer Florian Engelke have outdone themselves again on Ontology of Nought! Epic-length tracks ranging from 10 to 18 minutes fuse into a cohesive whole that awes with the band's characteristic technical flare and progressive, compositional brilliance. The impressive cast of session and guest musicians adds even more vibrancy.

Grug favourite parts:

1. Uncreation’s whirring loom you ply with crippled fingers `0:00` - Moment
2. To weave the tapestry of nought `0:00` - Moment
3. The blossoms of your tomorrow shall unfold in my heart `0:00` - Moment
4. Lest I should perish with travel, effete and weary, as my knees refuse to bear me thither `0:00` - Moment
5. The barren earth oozes blood, and shakes and moans, to drink her children’s gore `0:00` - Moment
