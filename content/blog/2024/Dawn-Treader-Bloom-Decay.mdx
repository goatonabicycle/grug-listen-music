[Words about album will go here]

Feels. More music need speeches.

Love instrumental sections. Immediately put Grug in introspective place.

Post feels metal always about build up and bring down. Ups so high. Downs so low.

Lead guitar so confident.

Love art. Beautiful

All instruments import. Guitar always what pulls most.

Soar. Say things but no words. No need understand like understand words. Understand different way.

Voices of nice sing. Voices of growl. Voices of sample

Grug love when black metal shriek and evil. But learning that love love love when hit feels.

Easy to make feels seem cheesy and cheap. Feels here feel expensive. Feel serious.

Beautiful album. Beautiful cover.

Grug see “too many samples”. Grug think not enough! Not hear many samples long time and miss it. Love it!

Grug dying wish to return to the earth
