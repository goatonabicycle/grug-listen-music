Grug love tech death. Normally tech death feel noodly. Future space and aliens! Here tech death the feel like flesh and blood. Like cooking meat on a fire. Powerful and strong tech death.

Riffs are exceptional. No want to even imagine what tabs are like. But solos take to extra level. Happen couple of time. Song go one way. Then solo start and go other way. Grug make special mention of bass and how crazy it is. Whole extra life that often missing from metal. So much groove. Keeping up with guitar like this no easy. Vocals monsterous. From multiple people. Shout at each other! Bring so much energy. Each voice more scary and intense than one before. And so many styles.

  `What calls out from beneath the dream of being?` <br />
  `What lies beyond the mask of man?` <br />
  `The everything and the nothing at all` <br />
  `To be is to deceive`
</div>

Love blends of black metal feels in tech death. Lots of easy to miss ambience. If you told Grug this will be thing when Grug was young, would not believe you that possible. Work so well here. Can be busy. Challenging listen. Not just always full. Space to breathe. Grug love when finding music that help with angry. Positive angry. Hopeful angry. Beautiful angry. Not feel distant like alien or spaceship. Not shouting at you. Shouting with you. Tech death that feel like fighting but on your side against others.

This music make Grug feel like never want to even bother try make music? What's the
point? Will never be this good and interesting. Grug never play this complex and
this fast. But at same time, inspire Grug. Make Grug want to make music. Make Grug
feel like part of something. This album feel like the best meat you keep for when
your favourite friend come to your fire. A reminder that music can be technical,
brutal, fast, and blood, groove and flesh. Techdeath that breathes and can feel with
you. With so much diverse between songs. Amount of skill and talent too big to think.

Not joke when every single song has multiple moment when Grug go wow. <br />
Not one boring riff. Not one boring moment. <br />
Too many moments of big groove. <br />
Too many moments that make favourite. <br />
