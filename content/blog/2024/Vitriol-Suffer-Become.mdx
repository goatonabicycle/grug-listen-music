Grug love tech death. Normally tech death feel noodly. Future space and aliens! Here tech death the feel like flesh and blood. Like cooking stuff on a fire. Powerful and strong tech death. 

This music make Grug feel like never want to even bother try make music? What's the point? Will never be this good and interesting. Grug never play this complex and this fast. 

But at same time, inspire Grug. Make Grug want to make music. Make Grug feel like part of something. 

Love blends of black metal feels in tech death. If you told Grug this will be thing when Grug was young, would not believe you that possible. Work so well here. 

Grug love when finding music that help with angry. Positive angry.

Description from bandcamp: In their latest release, "Suffer & Become," Portland's VITRIOL persists in their resolute pursuit to both refine and redefine the very essence of modern death metal. Expertly recorded by the band's visionary frontman, Kyle Rassmussen, and skillfully mixed by Dave Otero (known for his work with Archspire and Cattle Decapitation), VITRIOL's second full-length album wholeheartedly embraces mind-bending technical intricacies and unadulterated ferocity, leaving long-time fans who've witnessed their stage-demolishing prowess alongside acts like Morbid Angel and Cattle Decapitation utterly stunned. Tracks like "Shame and Its Afterbirth" and "Weaponized Loss" offer unadulterated forays into a world of intense sonic exploration, drenched in dense, blackened sonics. VITRIOL's impact is nothing short of paradigm-shifting, obliterating barriers and establishing new standards, and "Suffer & Become" stands as an unequivocal masterpiece of contemporary extremity.
