Grug love tech death. Normally tech death feel noodly. Future space and aliens! Here tech death the feel like flesh and blood. Like cooking stuff on a fire. Powerful and strong tech death.

This music make Grug feel like never want to even bother try make music? What's the point? Will never be this good and interesting. Grug never play this complex and this fast. But at same time, inspire Grug. Make Grug want to make music. Make Grug feel like part of something.

Love blends of black metal feels in tech death. If you told Grug this will be thing when Grug was young, would not believe you that possible. Work so well here. Although very busy. Challenging listen. Not just always full. Space to breathe.

Grug love when finding music that help with angry. Positive angry. Hopeful angry. Not feel distant like alien or spaceship. Not shouting at you. Shouting with you. Tech death that feel like it on your side against everything else.

This album feel like the best meat you keep for when your favourite friend come to your fire. A reminder that music can be technical, brutal, fast, and blood, groove and flesh. Techdeath that breathes and can feel with you. Amount of skill and talent too big to think.

`What calls out from beneath the dream of being?` <br />
`What lies beyond the mask of man?` <br />
`The everything and the nothing at all` <br />
`To be is to deceive`

Riffs are exceptional. NO want to even imagine what tabs are like. But solos take to extra level. Happen couple of time. Song go one way. Then solo start and go other way.

Grug make special mention of bass and how crazy it is. Whole extra life that often missing from metal. So much groove. Keeping up with guitar like this no easy.

Vocals monsterous. From multiple people. Shout at each other!

Too many moments that make favourite. Too many moments of big groove. Too many moments of feel wow.
