Grug have big love for tech death. Sometimes tech death sound like noodles. Future, space, and aliens! Here tech death feel like flesh and blood. Like heart-beat. Like thick meat on a fire. Powerful and strong tech death.

Every instrument here exceptional. No want to even imagine what tabs look like. Solos take to extra level. Not just for look good. Add mountains of feeling to song. Grug love when song go one way then solo make song go new way.
Grug make special shout of bass, wild and fierce! Whole extra life that sometimes lost from metal. So much groove. Grug have new name when talking of favourite bass player! Voices thunder, scare sky. Many Grugs roar, cry, like big fight of sounds! Bring so much energy. Each voice wilder, stronger than last, keep calls interesting in storm.

Love blends of black metal feels in tech death. Lots of easy to miss ambience. If you told Grug this will be thing when Grug was young, would not believe you that possible. Work so well here. Can be busy. Challenging listen. Not just always full. Space to breathe. Grug love when finding music that help with angry. Positive angry. Hopeful angry. Beautiful angry. Not feel distant like alien or spaceship. Not shouting at you. Shouting with you. Feel like fighting but on your side against others.

This music make Grug feel like never want to even bother try make music? Why bother? Grug never be this good! Grug never play this difficult and
this fast. But at same time, inspire Grug. Make Grug want to make music. Make Grug feel like part of something. This album feel like the best meat you keep for when your favourite friend come to your fire.
Remind Grug that music can be sharp, fierce, quick, but also dance with blood, groove, and life. Tech death that breathe and feel with
you. With so much diverse between songs. Amount of skill and talent too big to think!
