Grug love deathcore. Not care for people hate normal. Grug head whawha! "Not real music"! Just shouts!
Honestly. This is more violent than most of what Grug hear. Insane

Grug love when metal make feels. Lots of beauty and feels here.
But metal also about make smash in face.

Grug have hear before that "metal is like classical music" but then people talk about Metallica or something like that. What?
No it is not. That is nothing like. Grug want more violin. Not in cheese mode where sometimes have violin. But violin with guitar. Violin play crazy riffs. Violin so fast!
