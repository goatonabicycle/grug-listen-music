[Words about album will go here]

Description from bandcamp: 'A Theft' is the new full length album from Still. 



On only their second full-length record, Still has captured the intensity, tension, and emotion of the incredibly difficult
 circumstances surrounding its creation. Grief, desperation, and the weight of injustice from life's all-too-common cruelty seep into every moment of every track. Unpredictable and unorthodox, the album blurs the lines between contemporary avant-garde black metal, chaotic hardcore, and experimental noise, resulting in a stunning and deeply affecting work.
