[Words about album will go here]

Love that album start with mediate feels then Oh. We are suddenly here!

# Instruments
Grug get captured by how wild, hairy, but precise guitar feel. Mix dirty caveman with clean doctor gloves.

Love ambient sounds between songs. Strings play in background make feel like in place that not have electricity. Never will have electricity. Guitar jump between notes

Lyrics make out life pretty not good. Voice shout agony. Feel exactly like struggle on cover.
