Grug feel cold in bones when music take to far, icy lands. Like big journey with heavy heart. Grug say you must join, big life shift happen! Wind change direction and must follow.

Something bad must have happen. Life now different. Bad shadows fall. Life heavy, paths few. Deep cold, deep sorrow in music, like winter night and no fire. All this most from keys and long, mourn guitar strings that tell grand but sad story.

Synth dance light, playful over other sounds. Like butterfly over big rocks. Carry song as foundataion! Normally, drum-guitar relationship most important. What make good or bad foundation. Here guitar and keys relationship equal important as if playful friends together make sway around like snow. Grug surprise when man sing big clean voice like mountain stream! But sing so raspy and feels! Rhythm of drums flow so fast. So many drum hits! Kick drum especially feel so fast and add so much groove feel. Grug love when fast snare but also amazing when black metal has really fast, intense kick drum sections.

Grug love how parts feel grin, grim, and brutal and little later feel pretty with synths and lovely melodies. Music fierce but then bloom pretty like flower after rain. Heavy and angry but soothing and can't stop listen! Songs make feel like riding in horse to somewhere uncertain and scary and cold. Sections not scared to go very slow and focus on small idea before exploding into grand angry! This black metal not scare Grug. It give hope, like breathe air outside cave first time long time.

This last Grug shrine of 2023. Year of begin. Grug learn so much from building shrines. Clearly Grug love black metal with so beautiful melodies and feels. Ringarë do this so perfectly!
