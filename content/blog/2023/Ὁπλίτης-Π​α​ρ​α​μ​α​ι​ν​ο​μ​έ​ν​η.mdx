This band name actually break Grug website. Grug had to fix! Grug so surprise for find this. Read that human from China but words and voice in old Greek. So strange that Grug cannot ignore that!
So much interesting in story around music. So much interesting in music around story.

#Language Lyrics Vocals
Whispers of man. Sound like man from long time ago much older than Grug. Sound like wise man have knowledge of things Grug will never learn.
Something freeing about not understand lyrics. Makes words interesting in while different way. Make Grug feel like hearing something not actually supposed to.

#Music
Song changes on whim. So fast. So slow! You think you are ready? You are not. So much happening.
Like noodles dripping from my face. Flowing over Grug eyes.
Dissonant music sometimes just irritating. Not here.

#Sax.
Normally Grug no like saxophone. Grug imagine ghost, pale face, jump up over shoulder everytime sax play. Jump scare. Sometimes out of nowhere. Unsettle.

#Styles
Many black metal. Many progressive. Change all time! Sometimes chugs!

This music give Grug constant need to share with people and go "Listen this!". Hear the amazing! Hear the strange! This is so, so good.
