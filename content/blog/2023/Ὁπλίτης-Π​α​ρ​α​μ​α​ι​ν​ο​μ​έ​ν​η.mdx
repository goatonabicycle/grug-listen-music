First song Grug want you to take a guitar an slide up and down. It's the best thing.

Song changes on a whim. You think you are ready? You are not.

So much happening. Grug not think would enjoy aaxaphone

Something freeing about not understand lyrics. Makes words interesting in while different way.

Like noodles dripping from my face.

Grug imagine ghost, pale face, jump up over shoulder everytime sax play. Jump scare. Sometimes out of nowhere. Unsettle.

Dissonant music sometimes just irritating. Not here.

Whispers of man. Sound like man from many moon ago much older than Grug. Sound like wise man have knowledge of things Grug will never learn.

This band name actually break Grug website. Grug had to fix!

Second song. Long sad sax. 05:40

Third song - 1:40. So prog difficult keep track where to count on Grug fingers.

5th song: 2:15.
