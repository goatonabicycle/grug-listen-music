Band name so strong, it break Grug's website! Grug fix with big club! Grug big surprise for find this! Humans from land of dragons, but sing like old Greek cave-paintings. So strange that Grug cannot ignore that!
So much interesting story around music. So much interesting music around story. Strange instrument sound-makers, Grug not know names. Make noises like ancient beasts!

Man's whispers come from time so old, older than Grug's oldest ancestor, like tales from ancient starry nights. Sound like wise man have knowledge of things Grug will never learn. Something free about not understand lyrics. Makes words interesting in whole different way. Make Grug feel like hearing something not actually supposed to. The moments when man talk over music are Grug favourite.

Music progress so much. Change all time on whim. Make Grug's heart beat fast, then slow, like hunting mammoth. You think you are ready? You no ready! So much happen. Normally Grug no like saxophone. Grug see cave-ghost, white as moon, pale face, jump behind Grug when sax howlsJump scare. Sometimes out of nowhere. Unsettle. Actually feel strange when hear. When guitar and sax have solo off it feel like important moment in grug musical development.

This sound-magic make Grug want gather tribe, shout 'Hear this with ear-holes!'. Hear the amazing! Hear the strange! This is so, so good. Grug not same after listen.
