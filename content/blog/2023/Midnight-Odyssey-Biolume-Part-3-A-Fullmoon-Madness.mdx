Many moods and feels. Grug so surprise this album. Grug see thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/KManriffs" target="_blank">@KManriffs</a> that this is 8 album. That so many albums! Grug think wow! Then Grug see that this part of 1,2,3 albums. Trilogy? Wow! So big ideas. But then Grug see this album 2 hours and 5 minutes. Grug no process. How band make so many music? Can’t be good? Maybe full of empty space like hidden tracks from long ago? NO! So many music! Then Grug scroll down on bandcamp and see this all made by one person. One. Grug feel jaw lower to ground. Maybe time work different in Australia! Maybe unique Move so perfect between fast like hare to slow like tortoise.

Grug love how “Black metal” can mean so many different things. Not just on this album but in general. Grug reminded of Crow black Sky in some sections, Valdrin others. Atmosphere! Some atmosphere sections feel so calm! Some feel threatening. Effects make sections so great. Spoken word details the story. Various parts make Grug feel like floating up. Opera. Poem. Epic. Angry. Sad. Happy. Everything. Grug favourite music! Dungeon synth! Black metal! Space black metal! Grug love the feels. Love the star wars like trumpets. So many voices. Black metal voice. Many different clean sing voice. Speak word voice. Choir voice. Beautiful lady voice. All voice! Synth special character. Defining all the passages. Grug hear strange instruments never hear especially second last song. Love when guitars create wall that feel like wind blowing! Love when horns supposed to sound epic. Here sound so evil! Can feel evil monster coming over hill.

Grug happy that big song but never feel boring. Grug skip easy and no skip here. So much music surely there are bad tracks! Of course! Grug just not find them on this album! So satisfying when section/riff/sounds from much earlier in songs come back to give feeling of relief. So happy every time song give Grug goose skin! Grug feel like sleeping in the sky. Dreaming in the black empty. Grug so happy put in time investment here. Make Grug feel not alone in this universe. Make Grug look at music differently from now on. Grug will listen many time again!
