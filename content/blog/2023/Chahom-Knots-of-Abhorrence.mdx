Grug talk about music make fight. Music make sad. Music make so many everything. But nothing more close to Grug sounds than this. Actually sound like cave! Actually sound like Grug!

So strange sounds! Flutes! Whistles! Ghost haunt! Grug feel scared! Beautiful! Big. Powerful. Feel cave walls come closer and closer and Grug not able to breathe anymore. Feel like Grug have to go war to fight other Grugs. Feel like Grug have to worry about someone burning Grug cave.

Dance around fire music. Drum and ancestors and shadows and smoke in Grug eyes. Smoke in Grug lungs. Grug see things not there. Grug hear new things every time listen!

Guitars feel dance around fire side to side. Sometimes perfect together. Sometimes each doing own thing. Angry guitar fight each other.

So pretty cover picture. Picture not make ready for type music. Music no that. Cover make Grug think nice and pretty. Music make Grug feel inhaling smoke from burning

All Grug favourite music make Grug go on journey. Here journey is full anxiety and feel like happen long long time ago. Time before there colour. Time where all Grug always kill other Grug. Not like now when Grug more safe.

Look! Pals already in cave!
