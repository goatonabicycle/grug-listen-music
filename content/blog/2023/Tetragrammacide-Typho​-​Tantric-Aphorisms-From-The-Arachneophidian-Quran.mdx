If bright cave fire sing, it sound like this! Grug not know India sound like here! Grug want listen more! Music make Grug want see more such album covers. Make Grug wow!

Music have so evil feel! Grug never see titles like this and not know what say. Grug not know much history, but want to think and learn. Grug want to know why 4 leg blue lady have demon head in hand? Grug think not good time for demon man!

Music sometime have sound slow play parts and so good making Grug feel like there! Sound like bug eating and screaming outside Grug's cave waiting for Grug go outside!

Guitar feel like big story teller. Grug like singing voice, but guitar voice add much tension. Guitar not friendly, Grug would not approach in wild. Drums make Grug want to move head back and front. So fast, so well structured, Grug not stay still. Drums float and make feel strong. Guitar riffs complicated, make Grug wish to make them too. Riffs sinister, make Grug want to run, fill head with many notes.
