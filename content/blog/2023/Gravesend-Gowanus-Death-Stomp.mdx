Grug like cave. Feel nice. No drunk other Grugs fight Grug. Grug never been real fight. Confrontation, yes. Not fight.

This closest to a fight Grug ever feel in music. Fight that not stop. Going fast fast fast. Jump between many fights! Grug feel like music punch in face through screen and ears! Punch with big muscles! This make Grug want never go New York.

Shout sounds raspy Grug wonder if man get sore throat from cheese grate! Shouts make Grug scared in good way. Grug imagine drummer and guitars is strong!

Some parts make Grug feel uneasy, but this still great work out music. Motivation music. Grug can imagine seeing this music live must be fun jump mosh stomping around with panic alarm feeling. Like angry bees chasing Grug cave! Scary! Many amount of time Grug make face with “fuck yes” feeling in heart and smirk on face. This great for feeling when “Grug want most angry thing possible right now”.

2. Crown of Tar `02:45` - Grug feel like flex muscle!
3. Lupara Bianca `02:17` - Shouty man eat something bad! EEEEEEEUUUUUUUGHGG!!!
