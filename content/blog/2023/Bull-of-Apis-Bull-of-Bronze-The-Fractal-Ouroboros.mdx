Grug like go walks. Listen to music on walks. When walk Grug like to really, really focus on music. Almost like mediate. Grug try hear everything and try understand.
Grug think of how people make music and what make them go this way or that. This album everything feel so specific design for Grug listen. M

Apprarently, Grug like long albums. This one 75 minutes.

One of Grug ritual is to walk around yard and listen to music on headphone. Walk up down! Grug dogs follow first but then realize they no go walkies and just watch Grug walk around.
Ritual of keeping things moving. So powerful. So direct like stab.

When guitar make feel like top of mountain in blizard!

Long passages of think.

Lyrics

`As light, our chains fall away`

Ambiance play so important role. Grug come back to it. Grug would listen if Bull of Apis Bull of Bronze make whole album just black metal. Grug would listen if Bull of Apis Bull of Bronze make whole album just ambient. Grug love saying name this band. Feel like casting spell! Like calling someone important.
