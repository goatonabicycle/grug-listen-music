Grug never see wizard with own eyes. Hear about sometimes but Grug think made up. If real, Finland many wizard Grug think. Maybe because many castle or many forest? Make grug feel replace club with sword.

If Grug ever own castle Grug would play this only! Guitar so fast so nice! Make Grug happy have long hair to blow in wind. Grug have big fun when listening this. Grug feel like stand on top of mountain without shirt and eagle flying around but also [snowing and crabbing around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VBdAY8eA9w).

Grug love men standing and staring in freeze with castle:

Grug like to imagine playing in music listening to. Not here. Guitar too fast too cool. Grug not fast like that. Guitar go up and down so fast black metal not always like this. Grug like when guitar solo fast. If not fast, must be tasty. Taste warm, taste like big fire!

Grug happy every song start strong then not stop being good! Song writing keep songs stuck in Grug head so long time. That real magic! Grug wonder, "Why all best music have castle picture on front?"

Grug favourite parts:

1. To Withhold the Day `02:00` - Solo wild like baby grug tantrum!
2. Yönsilmä `0:00` - Grug play again and again. Beginning make Grug's ears happy. Best thing Grug hear long time.
3. Into the Silvery Shadows of Night `0:00` - Light leave from tiny fire no wood left.
