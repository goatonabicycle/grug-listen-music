Grug always appreciate Full of Hell. Seems like good Grugs.

Grug  listen enough music to know that you need soft part and loud part. Fast part and slow part. Music can be all slow and all fast, yes! But many time to really feel the fast you have to have slow first. And to really feel the slow you have to have fast! 

Music make Grug want to hug Grug dogs. Make feel of better time somewhere else with less things going on.

Music also make Grug think
