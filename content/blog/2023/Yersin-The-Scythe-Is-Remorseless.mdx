Instruments

Grug love guitar tone. It feel like strings wet! Dripping with green goo. Dripping into ears and making burn! Shouts and music make so easy to bob head. Grug enjoy when can hear accent in album

Cover and feels.

- Simple but very catchy. Not feeling make head whirl. Make head bounce!
- So many riffs for stuck in head. So many punch in head.
- This album face make to minute ratio is high! Every couple moments Grug go "Ooof, yes"
  Catchy
