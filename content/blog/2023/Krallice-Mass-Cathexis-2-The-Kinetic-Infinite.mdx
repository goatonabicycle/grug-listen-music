This music for spiders with really long legs. Spiders that crawl very, very fast. Spiders that are exact and precise with movements. Spiders take other animal minds. Control them! Grug very impress with how perfect Krallice make music for spiders!

Song feel like going to go fast! Then no! Then extremely fast! Then very slow. All feel unsettling. Think notes go 1, 2, 3 , 4 then notes only go 1, 2, 3. Then opposite! Grug think go direction but change! Then change back to direction! Grug feel like caught in wild wind storm, like on album front skin! Maybe that where spiders make music! Grug see bass and guitar jump, twirl like dance at fire. Grug think guitar neck must be so strong branch with how much go up down left right! Bass guitar sound always hear in Grug ear. Boom boom! In black metal!? Wow! Grug feel tingle and shake. Love this! Many strange interesting voices. Voice feel like in pain! Maybe spiders eating man?

Grug love how sickly guitars feel. Like skinny thin spider. Crawl all over Grug skin. No amount of hitting can get them off! Just crawl everywhere! Make Grug head spin, spin, spin! Maybe jump into fire will help! Move so fast up and down like building a nest. Album later become lighter but even more creepy. First half has warned of what is coming! Love how sections repreat to make Grug feel weird. Grug relief when some section repeat or some section have simple pattern. Make feel like water on Grug face. Like spiders stop for a moment.

Should music always make feel comfy? Sometimes! Should it irritate Grug? Never! Should it make Grug feel things? Absolutely! But Grug think spiders can definitely live here:
