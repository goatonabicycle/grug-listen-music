Grug not have little Grugs. They need many shiny rocks and time and much noise wha wha, NO! Sometime Grug think maybe could be nice have someone to throw rocks at or with.

Black metal weird, like fire and ice together. Make feel fuzzy inside. Make feel fly high and stab hurt feels. Village on fire, snow fall, all same time. World full of fire, full of bad. Not things Grug can bonk with club. Music here make Grug not want little Grugs. Feel no sun come tomorrow.

Cover painting match music good. Need much talent make music like this. Tell story. Go on journey. Have many voices, loud, feel lots. Lots of words. Think much. Very special. Synth demon make spooky whoooooo fit so great.

Feel canâ€™t make fire. Just want sleep in dark. How Grug care for little Grug when world dark like this? When air around Grug feel heavy? Make Grug sad, make Grug mad! But things easy to smash, easy break. Hard to make good life without woe.

Grug listen many time future again again.

Grug favourite parts:

1. Distant Epitaphs `05:51` - Angel speak soft pretty wow.
2. Shores of Extinction `0:00` - Whole start feel Grug make stinky face.
3. Far Beyond the Fracture of the Sky `07:40` - Guitar feel like friend not seen long time.
