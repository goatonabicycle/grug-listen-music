Many Grug pals shout about this sound stone so long. Many grug says whaa whaa whaa must listen this. NO. Grug listen now only! Grug no longer resist pretty front picture.

Grug surprise how much Grug miss out. Grug like whirling and wizzling like being chased by tiger. Complex and interesting everything! Guitar make nice sound feel like tribe from other sun rock maybe. Grug like when album start bang bang drum. So fast so nice wow!

When music sing speak me feel at home. Like cave. Grug understand words immediately. Man in cave shouty shouty. Man think hard but also Rah Rah. Music sound fast but natural. Grug feel like grass under toes. Like wind in grug beard. Make sound like death metal from many winters before. But also sound of pretty wow. Will of Whispers make grug miss childhood.

```
Time without haste
Patience without release
You light your way to sorrow
```

Grug almost understand!

Wag chin up down up down. Grug think "Mmmmm." when parts play like (specific timestamps.) Grug feel ooooooh when (other timestamps). Alone play guitar go Whah Whah. Fateâ€™s Tangled Thread at 04:50 make grug think shaking baby

Grug have emotional connection to music songs here. All feel like made by real pure grug pals that love doing this. Make me feel like I am in strange place. Good sounds must do that. Grug never want visit moldy tomb. But Grug want more Tomb Mold.
