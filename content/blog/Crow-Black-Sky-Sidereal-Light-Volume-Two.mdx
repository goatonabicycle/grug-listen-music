Grug not like crows. Crows kaa kaa and keen Grug from sleep in cave. Sleep in cave important for Grug health.

Important to go out cave. To be outside. Grug love tiny shiny light in sky. Fren tell Grug each light big light just far. No make sense.

Music feel grand. Feel important. Feel like Grug floating. peacefully in spacecave seeing beautiful colourful. Flow. Gravity. Synths add so much character

Words rhyme so nice. Make Grug feel calm and at peace even reading them. Also hearing them from shout. Shouts many variate and all make Grug want to practice.

Grug learn that "Sidereal" does not mean being real on side. Grug learn that Hyphal mean long structure thing, like songs! sophic mean wisdom. Grug feel much stronger in think head after this.

All best music make grug feel like time not moving. Best music make Grug feel like something important happen. This best music.

Grug have starlight in eyes.

Grug favourite parts:

1. The Sapien Shadow `05:39`
2. Omniscient `03:53`
